                Leira is India&apos;s first essential oil based intimate perfume, crafted for the
                delicate external intimate skin, including the bikini area and other sensitive areas.
                Dermatologically tested and alcohol-free, it works in harmony with your body&apos;s
                natural chemistry rather than overpowering it.
